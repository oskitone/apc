The Oskitone APC wants to be hacked and modified!

Here are some ideas:

- Add a quick-and-dirty interrupt button by wiring a switch between the battery's positive wire and the PCB "**+**" pad. [It's fun](https://www.instagram.com/p/CMz4yeIjg4J/)!
- Want an output jack? Try connecting the speaker pins to a 1/8" or 1/4" jack, but be careful about connecting directly to sensitive equipment &mdash; the output voltage is the battery's 9v, which is much higher than a typical line-level 1v!
  - [There _is_ a way to make an Atari Punk Console have line-level output](https://compiler.kaustic.net/machines/apc.html), but it doesn't account for a built-in speaker, so you may have to sacrifice it.
