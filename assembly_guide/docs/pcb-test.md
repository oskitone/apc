All done! Let's test it.

1.  Reconnect the **battery**.
2.  Slide power **switch**.
3.  Adjust the volume at **RV103** and the two bigger **potentiometers** until you hear noises coming out of the **speaker**. If you did, congrats! You successfully soldered your **Oskitone APC**!
4.  If not, don't worry. It's time to debug:
    - Check all your solder joints again
    - Are the components with polarity (**+** and **-** sides) right?
    - Is the **556 chip** pushed all they way into the socket? And none of its legs are bent?
    - Try using a multimeter to confirm power and ground are at all the pins you'd expect, referring to the schematic.
