Last is the bigger components: pots, speaker, and IC.

1. Push the two **500k pots** into their footprints at **RV101** and **RV102**
   1. A trick to get the pot to snap in better is to _gently_ push its tabs inward before popping it onto the PCB.
   2. Check that they're flat against the PCB, then solder into place.
   3. You can solder the mounting pins on the side too, if you want!
2. Fit the **speaker** into **LS101**, matching its **+** and **-** pins to the right holes.
   1. Don't bend its leads! That can break it.
   2. Solder. This can be tricky because it might fall out when you flip the board over. One way to do it is to [bring the board to the solder instead of the other way around](https://www.instagram.com/p/BdvbqTtloH5/). You can also try taping the component in place or use "mounting putty."
3. And the absolute last component to solder is the **IC socket**
   1. Place the **IC socket** into **U101**, matching its little indentation to the footprint.
   2. Solder using the same technique you did for the **speaker** to hold it in place.
   3. Insert the **556 chip** into the **socket**, matching its indentation.
