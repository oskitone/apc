:::note
Take your time and make sure the pots and speaker are perfectly flat against the PCB before soldering all of their pins.

Last is the bigger components: pots, speaker, and IC.

1. Push the two **500k pots** ("pot" short for "potentiometer"!) into their footprints at **RV101** and **RV102**
   1. A trick to get the pot to snap in better is to _gently_ push its mounting tabs inward before popping it onto the PCB.

   2. Check that they're flat against the PCB, then solder into place.
   3. You can solder the mounting tabs on the side too, if you want!
2. Fit the **speaker** into **LS101**, matching its **+** and **-** pins to the right holes.
   1. Don't bend its leads! That can break it.
   2. Hold in place and solder. <!-- TODO: advise on technique -->

   3. Check that the **speaker** is flat against the PCB before continuing.

3. And the absolute last component to solder is the **IC socket**
   1. Place the **IC socket** into **U101**, matching its little indentation to the footprint.

   2. Hold in place and solder. <!-- TODO: advise on technique -->

4. With its socket soldered, we can add its **556 chip**.
   1. In order to fit well into its **socket**, the pins of the **556** need to point straight down from the chip's body. You can use a [pin straightener tool](https://www.jameco.com/z/ICS-01-R-Jameco-Benchpro-IC-Pin-Straightener-for-0-300-and-0-600-Wide-ICs_99363.html) or simply bend them against any flat surface. <!-- TODO: advise on technique -->

   2. Carefully insert the **556 chip** into the **socket** at **U101**, matching its indentation. If its pins don't seem to go in well, try the previous step again.
