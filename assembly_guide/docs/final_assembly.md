1. Insert **switch clutch** into its cavity in the **enclosure top**.
   - It will fit in with room to slide back and forth.

2. Insert **PCB** into **enclosure top**.
   - It should fit perfectly without too much force. Wiggle the **switch clutch** around if it's not in the right place.

3. Insert **battery** into its spot in the **enclosure bottom**.
   - Its wires can be tucked under the PCB

4. Slide **enclosure bottom** onto **enclosure top**.
   - This will hold the battery and **PCB** in place.

   - **Troubleshooting: enclosure halves are getting stuck and can't slide together all the way**
     - Make sure the **PCB** is pushed into the enclosure top all the way. Then, when sliding the enclosure bottom on, try bending it slightly _out_ where its rails meet the **PCB**.

5. Fit **wheels** into their cavity wells on the **enclosure top** and onto the pot shafts.
   - They should also fit perfectly without too much force.
     ![Add wheels](/img/assembly/wheel.jpg)
   - **Troubleshooting: Wheels aren't popping on all the way:**
     - Use a butter knife (or similar flat tool like a flathead screwdriver or paint spatula) to pop the **wheel** off its pot, then press it back on. Sometimes it just takes another try!

You're done! Excellent work!
