1. Insert switch clutch into its cavity in the enclosure top.

2. Insert PCB into enclosure top. It should fit perfectly without too much force. Wiggle the switch clutch around if it's not in the right place.

3. Insert battery into its spot in the enclosure bottom.

4. Slide enclosure bottom onto enclosure top. This will hold the battery and PCB in place.

   - **Troubleshooting:** If the enclosure halves aren't sliding together all the way
     - First make sure the PCB is pushed into the enclosure top all the way. Then, when sliding the enclosure bottom on, try bending it slightly _out_ where its rails meet the PCB.

5. Fit wheels into their cavities on the enclosure top, onto the pot shafts. They should also fit perfectly without too much force.

## Troubleshooting

- **Wheels aren't popping on all the way:**<br />
  Use a butter knife (or similar flat tool like a flathead screwdriver or paint spatula) to pop the wheel off its pot, then reassemble. Sometimes it just takes another try!
