## General tips

Any of these problems can cause a variety of "just not working right" errors in a circuit. Familiarize yourself with these troubleshooting checks and do them regularly.

- Turn the PCB over and check all solder joints. A majority of problems are caused by insufficient or errant soldering. Familiarize yourself with what a good joint looks like in the [Adafruit Guide To Excellent Soldering](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-guide-excellent-soldering).
- Is the chip in the right orientation? It will have a notch/dimple that should match the footprint outline on the PCB.
- Does the battery have enough power? It should measure 9 volts. Try replacing with a fresh battery and see if that solves your issue.

## Specific issues

- If thereâ€™s buzzing, check for any metal scraps stuck to the speaker.
