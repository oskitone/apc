Next we'll do the remaining small, passive components.

1. There are two small ceramic capacitors:
   1. The one marked _103_ is for **.01uF** (also known as 10nF). It goes to **C101**.
      ![TODO: .01uF to C101](https://dummyimage.com/1920x1080/000/fff)
   2. The other's marked _104_, for **.1uF**, and goes to **C102**.
      ![TODO: .1uF to C102](https://dummyimage.com/1920x1080/000/fff)
2. The last cap is an electrolytic **10uF** capacitor at **C103**.
   - Match the capacitor's white stripe to the white part of the footprint.

3. The remaining resistor is **1k ohms**, colored _Brown Black Red_.
   - Solder to **R102**.
     ![TODO: 1k ohms to R102](https://dummyimage.com/1920x1080/000/fff)
4. The small, blue **1k trim potentiometer** goes to **RV103**. It's marked _102_.
   - We want it perfectly flat against the PCB, so, just like the LED and switch, make sure it's all the way in there before soldering all of its legs.

5. Nothing to test here, but check all solder joints and trim leads before moving on. We're almost done!

<!-- TODO: consider breaking out test from the rest of the steps -->
