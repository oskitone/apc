A decapitated robot head? An extraterrestrial communicator? A specter summoner?

Nope (and yep!), it's an [APC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atari_Punk_Console)!

## Um, WHAT

The APC (Atari Punk Console) is some kind of noise toy. Its circuit was originally described in the early 80s but it was such a hit that it's become something of a go-to project for folks new to electronics and soldering! There are _tons_ of versions of it but they all share the same basic parts.

The Oskitone APC is the function of the classic circuit in an Oskitone form. It's not very useful or musically pleasant, but it's fun!

I wrote a lot of words about this particular Atari Punk Console here, its design and history with the POLY555, and some other stuff here: [Oskitone Makes an Atari Punk Console](https://blog.tommy.sh/posts/oskitone-makes-an-atari-punk-console/)
